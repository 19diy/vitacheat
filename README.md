This was initially a repository for my own codes and since our discovery of the pointer search and my collaborations with various GBATemp users it has grown from a personal-only repository into a full database. @ShumnoT's [VitaCheatDatabase](https://github.com/ShumnoT/VitaCheatDatabase) is now merged in this repo and forgive me if I fragmented the database but it needed to be done.

## Trainers ##

You can download trainers from [this](https://github.com/r0ah/vitacheat/trainers) directory (see [How to Use Trainers](https://github.com/r0ah/vitacheat/wiki/How-to-Use-Trainers)).
