This was initially a repository for my own codes and since our discovery of the pointer search and my collaborations with various GBATemp users it has grown from a personal-only repository into a full database. @ShumnoT's [VitaCheatDatabase](https://github.com/ShumnoT/VitaCheatDatabase) is now merged in this repo.

## Trainers ##

You can download trainers (cheat plugins) from [this](https://github.com/r0ah/vitacheat/tree/master/trainers) directory (see [How to Use Trainers](https://github.com/r0ah/vitacheat/wiki/How-to-Use-Trainers)).

## Testing and Reporting for Issues ##

There's no way I can test all the existing codes made by various code authors. You can help us by opening an issue to report your findings.

Please always specify the following before opening an issue:

* Game ID (ex: PCSE#####)
* Game version
* Game type (is it NoNpDrm/Vitamin/Mai/CP?)
