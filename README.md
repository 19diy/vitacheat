# README #

This was initially a repository for my own codes and since our discovery of the pointer search and my collaborations with various GBATemp users it has grown from a personal-only repository into a full database. @ShumnoT's [VitaCheatDatabase](https://github.com/ShumnoT/VitaCheatDatabase) is now merged in this repo.

## Cheat Plugins ##

You can download vosman's cheat plugins from [this](https://github.com/r0ah/vitacheat/tree/master/cheatplugin) directory (see [How to Use Cheat Plugins](https://github.com/r0ah/vitacheat/wiki/How-to-Use-Cheat-Plugins)).

* [In-Game Notes](https://github.com/r0ah/vitacheat/wiki/In-Game-Notes) - If FinalCheat add support for in-line note, folder, and remove the 50 limit (so we can have modifiers) for the next release of VitaCheat, I'll update all the psv files listed here and I'll also remove this entire section. For now, use this section as a separate reference.

## Submissions ##

You can submit your own codes by opening a [submission issue](https://github.com/r0ah/vitacheat/issues/new/code-submission). Please use the template!

You can also submit your codes in this [thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/vitacheat-finalcheat-database.485343). I don't visit everyday so mention my GBAtemp username `@Roah`.

Before you submit your codes you have to test it in this condition:

1. Close the game's bubble to restart the game
2. Do a full shutdown of your PSVita by holding the power button

If cheat doesn't work after doing all the steps then the game have DMA so don't submit it. To fix your code, go to the wiki and read the pointer code tutorials.

## Reporting ##

There's no way I can test all the existing codes made by various code authors. You can help us by opening an issue. Please use the template below!

Before reporting any issues, make sure you have the same game version as the one indicated in the cheat file. Some cheat may require specific game version.
