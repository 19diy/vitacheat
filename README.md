# README #

This was initially a repository for my own codes and since our discovery of the pointer search and my collaborations with various GBATemp users it has grown from a personal-only repository into a full database. @ShumnoT's [VitaCheatDatabase](https://github.com/ShumnoT/VitaCheatDatabase) is now merged in this repo.
