# Note: 1) The exp mods increases your Max EXP which will cause your NEXT EXP to go down and level you up, if that makes sense. Just turn the code on then off while you increase the numer based around your character's Maximum EXP and you'll go up a bunch of levels. Your exp bar will roll to the right off the screen but all you gotta do is go into a battle and leave or just summon that character into battle.
#  - 2) For the HQ code, I didn't even know HQ was a thing until I beat the game. I had to look it up when I noticed there was a number at the bottem of the menu. To put it simply, HQ goes up when you do certain things in game but also I think it had some kind of online tracking feature using the Vita's Near app and the more you travel the more it goes up or something like that. Basically high HQ = more exp and cheaper shop prices.
#  - 3) The lower your Command Attack Points the better your score. I haven't played around with the Ranking Shop(not really a shop) much but I decided to make a code for one of the facilities I tried. I'll come back to it eventually.
#  - I went back and updated some of the Mana and HL codes in my .psv by increasing the numbers a bit because as it turns out, you really do need a lot of money and mana. Even found a shop where 4,294,967,295(FFFFFFFF) money isn't enough. If there is a way to go higher than FFFFFFFF, that would be helpful.
#  - I got some more codes coming and those are the Innocent mods and those will need an entire post to explain as I got a lot to say on them, a lot to do with how the game works and stuff and some still need testing.
