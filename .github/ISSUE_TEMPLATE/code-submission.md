name: Code Submission
about: Submit your codes using this template

---

Do not forget to fill the **Version** and **Type** fields! If you don't specify the version then I'll just assume it was the base version. If no type is specified I won't add your code until you add the type in the comments.

Before you submit your codes you have to test it in this condition:

1. Close the game's bubble to restart the game
2. Do a full shutdown of your PSVita by holding the power button

If codes doesn't work after doing all the steps then the game have DMA. Go to the wiki and read the pointer code tutorials.

Use the code header below:
